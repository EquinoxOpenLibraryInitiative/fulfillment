The files in this folder define hotkey sets.

Each hotkey set should be name.keyset, where name is the name of the set.

hotkey.properites in the locale directory can set an alternate or translated name for a hotkey set.
You should use format like:
hotkey.name=newname

The backend code uses the filename derived name for everything else.


In the files a # denotes a comment, at the start of a line or in the middle.

Otherwise, the file format is as follows:

command,modifiers,key/keycode[,keytext]

command is the ID of the <command> node the hotkey will trigger.

modifiers is a space-delimited set of modifiers (if any):
    shift
    alt
    control
    meta
    accel
    any

Prefer accel over control/meta as it picks the appropriate one for the user's platform.
any makes any listed before it optional.

key/keycode is the key or virtual keycode for the hotkey. VK_ constants are treated as keycodes, everything else is a key.

keytext is an optional setting for specifying the hint text to appear on the menu items.
