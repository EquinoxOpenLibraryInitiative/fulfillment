# This test simulates interaction with GoodStuff hardware for the purpose
# of RFID scanning a patron card.  The hardware is capable of fielding
# multiple such cards in one pass, but the staff client will close the
# connection after the first successful card.
#
# Prerequisites:
#
# Requires expect and netcat to be installed, and expects for a pristine
# load of EG's stock test data to be installed.  In the staff client,
# pv_supa_goodstuff should be listed in the Add-Ons list under Admin ->
# Workstation Administration -> Server Add-ons.  In the GoodStuff
# preferences section, Enabled should be checked, the IP/Hostname field
# should point to the server running this test script, and the port
# should be 5000.  Networking should be configured to allow the client
# machine to reach port 5000 on this server.  If netcat is not installed
# as /bin/nc, change the spawn line below as appropriate.
#
# Steps:
#
# 1) Ensure the staff client is configured as per the prerequisites, and
#    clear all tabs in the staff client.
# 2) Invoke this script.
# 3) In the staff client, press F1 or invoke Circulation -> Checkout
#    Items.  If the RFID checkbox is unchecked, check it.
# 4) The script should run without errors, and the staff client should
#    show an attempt at loading a patron with card "bad_card", and then
#    the patron with card "99999376669" should load.  The script should
#    end without errors.
