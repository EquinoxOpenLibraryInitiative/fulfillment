#!/usr/bin/expect -f
# This test simulates interaction with GoodStuff hardware for the purpose
# of RFID scanning items for checkout.
#
# Prerequisites:
#
# Requires expect and netcat to be installed, and expects for a pristine
# load of EG's stock test data to be installed.  In the staff client,
# pv_supa_goodstuff should be listed in the Add-Ons list under Admin ->
# Workstation Administration -> Server Add-ons.  In the GoodStuff
# preferences section, Enabled should be checked, the IP/Hostname field
# should point to the server running this test script, and the port
# should be 5000.  Networking should be configured to allow the client
# machine to reach port 5000 on this server.  If netcat is not installed
# as /bin/nc, change the spawn line below as appropriate.
#
# Steps:
#
# 1) Ensure the staff client is configured as per the prerequisites, and
#    clear all tabs in the staff client.
# 2) Invoke this script.
# 3) In the staff client, press F4 or invoke Search -> Search for
#    Patrons.  Enter Smith for the last name and submit the search.
#    Retrieve the first patron, Cathy Smith.  If the RFID checkbox is
#    unchecked, check it.
# 4) The client will attempt to circulate CONC4000049, which is already
#    checked out to another user.  Click "Cancel".
# 5) The client will attempt to circulate CONC4000048, which is already
#    checked out to another user.  Click "Normal Checkin then Checkout".
# 6) The client will circulate CONC70000408, but the fake GoodStuff will
#    fail to deactivate the security flag for the item.  Click
#    "Deactivate Security".
# 7) The client will circulate CONC70000401, but the fake GoodStuff will
#    fail to deactivate the security flag for the item.  Click "Make No
#    Change".
# 8) The fake GoodStuff will report a problem with CONC70000394, that it
#    expected two parts but could only detect one.  Click "Re-Scan Item".
#    This item should circulate.
# 9) The fake GoodStuff will report a problem with CONC70000387, that it
#    expected two parts but could only detect one.  Click "Proceed with
#    Item".  This item should circulate.
# 10) Close the tab or click Done (and cancel any print job).  The script
#     should end without errors.
#
# Note: added some gratuitous whitespace near the end with the socket
#       messages; client should ignore whitespace
