This directory contains code for a simple archive file format, which
is documented at http://wiki.mozilla.org/Software_Update:MAR

The src directory builds a small static library used to create, read,
and extract an archive file.  The tool directory builds a command line
utility around the library, mar.

The tool directory also builds a modified version of bsdiff used by
the Mozilla update mechanism to generate patches.  This version was
modified from a recent copy of Colin Percival's, FreeBSD-licensed
bsdiff sources with the crc32 code taken from the Mozilla updater.
