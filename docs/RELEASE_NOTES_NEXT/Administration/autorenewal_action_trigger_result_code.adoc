Changes to Autorenewal Action/Trigger Failure Reasons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously the "reason" field in the userdata for an Autorenewal
event would contain both the failure code and the description for
the failure event as a single string such as
"MAX_RENEWALS_REACHED : Circulation has no more renewals remaining"
Now the "reason" field will only contain the description of the issue
(Circulation has ...) while a new "textcode" field will contain the
event code (MAX_RENEWALS_REACHED) if administrators still want to
display it in template outputs.
