Matomo Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for the open source web analytics platform Matomo is now
native to Evergreen. Support is on an org unit level so different
libraries can have separate or no analytics. Once you setup
a Matomo service you will need the URL and site ID. Typically
Matomo will give you a block of javascript you can insert into
web sites. One line will look like :

var u="http://mylibrary.lib/matomo/";

The full URL in the double quotes will be your URL.  Another line
will look like:

_paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);

In this case the number 1 will be your site ID.

These are set by YOAUSes opac.analytics.matomo_url and
opac.analytics.matomo_id respectively.  A new permsision,
MATOMO_UPDATE_SETTINGS, controls access to these.
