Preloaded Audio Icon and Search Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new search and icon format called Preloaded Audio now exists 
that overlaps with the eAudio format.  If you want to exclude
the Preloaded Audio format from overlapping with eAudio 
you can use the following SQL:

UPDATE config.composite_attr_entry_definition SET definition = '{"0":{"_attr":"item_type","_val":"i"},"1":[{"_attr":"item_form","_val":"o"},{"_attr":"item_form","_val":"s"}]}'
    WHERE coded_value IN (SELECT id FROM config.coded_value_map WHERE code = 'eaudio');

It is also recommended that you reingest your bibliographic records 
to updated the fixed field indexes. You can accomplish this by running
the following query in your database:

SELECT metabib.reingest_record_attributes(source)
FROM metabib.record_attr_vector_list WHERE
(SELECT id FROM config.coded_value_map WHERE ctype = 'item_form' AND code = 'q') = ANY(vlist)
AND (SELECT id FROM config.coded_value_map WHERE ctype = 'item_type' AND code = 'i') = ANY(vlist);
