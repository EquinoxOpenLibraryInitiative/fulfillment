Angular Acquisitions Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The acquisitions search interfaces are now written in Angular
and provide a new centralized place for searching Line Items,
Purchase Orders, Invoices, and Selection Lists in the Acquisitions
module of Evergreen. The Acquisitions Search interface can be accessed
under Acquisitions -> General Search.

The search interface has four tabs for line item search, purchase order
search, invoices search, and selection list search.  Each tab
offers a search form allowing the user to select one or more
fields to search on. Each search tab stores a separate default search
that the user can update; for example, a user could have their
line item search default to showing all on-order line items from
a particular provider.

The grid that displays search results in each tab is filterable.

The line items and PO search interfaces allow the user to navigate to
linked POs, invoices, and so forth, but offers no direct actions. The
invoices search tab includes a 'Print Selected Invoices' action,
while the selection lists search tab offers actions to create,
clone, delete, and merge selection lists.

The Angular search page contains a link to the legacy Dojo search
interface if needed. The Dojo interface will be removed in a future
release of Evergreen.

The Angular search interface offers various usability improvements
over the Dojo one, including:

* only the search operators that are relevant for a given field
  are displayed.
* search fields that are associated with controlled vocabularies
  will display drop-downs on the search form.
* results are sortable
* the line item and PO state fields have been relabeled to "Status"
* greater than and less than are now available as search operators
* publication date searches are more flexible

Adjustments to Stock Permissions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As part of this feature, the stock permissions for the Acquisitions
and Acquisitions Administrator profiles have been expanded. In
particular, the Acquisitions Administrator profile can now be
more readily used to perform normal acquisitions work in addition
to configuring the acquisitions module.
