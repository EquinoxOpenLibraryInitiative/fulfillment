Angular Providers Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The interfaces for searching for and managing acquisitions provider
records have been rewritten in Angular. This rewrite includes the
following significant changes:

* The provider search interface is now available directly from the
  Acquisitions menu, supplementing its longstanding availability from
  the Acquisitions Administration page.
* The search interface is modeled after the patron interface, including
  a search form that can be hidden or displayed, a provider summary box,
  and a multi-tabbed interface for managing the provider itself.
* The grid displaying search results is filterable and sortable.
* The provider display tabs are
 ** Details, allowing the user to view, and if permitted, edit
    the base provider record.
 ** Addresses
 ** Contacts
 ** Attribute Definitions
 ** Holdings Definitions
 ** EDI
 ** Invoices, providing an interface for viewing the invoices
    associated with the provider.
 ** POs, providing an interface for viewing the purchase orders
    associated with the provider.
* The new interface makes it possible to edit contact addresses.
* The base provider record now has an optional primary contact field.
  Selecting a contact as the primary one is managed on the Contacts
  tab.  The primary contact, if set, is displayed on the provider
  summary box.

Interfaces that used to link to the Dojo provider interface now link
to the Angular one instead.
