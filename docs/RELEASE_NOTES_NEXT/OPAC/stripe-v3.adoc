Credit card payments using Stripe now on version 3 (Elements)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When Stripe payments are enabled, the public catalog will now
use version 3 of the Stripe client library, as well as its
Elements API for building the credit card form.  For
technical reasons, this more easily lends a site to PCI
compliance.

On the staff side, the credit card option is disabled for
Stripe, as that has not been implemented and in the past
would just give an error.
