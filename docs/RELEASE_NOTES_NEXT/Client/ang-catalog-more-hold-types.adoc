Angular catalog recall/force/part holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Angular staff catalog now has entry points for placing Recall,
Force, and Part-level holds.

For any item-level hold type, the user now has the option to cycle
between Item, Recall, and Force hold types.  The selected type affects
the full batch of holds.

For title-level holds, the user now has the option to select a part
as the hold target for each record in the list.  Part selection is
optional.
