Hopeless Holds Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new interface under Local Administration has been added called
Hopeless Holds.  Using a new Hopeless Date field on hold requests,
this interface gives staff a way to resolve issues with hold
requests that may have become unfulfillable or "hopeless".

The Hopeless Date is set for a given request by the hold targeter
whenever the potential items list for the hold is empty, or when
all potential items have a copy status that has been designated
as Hopeless Prone (a new boolean field on copy statuses).
