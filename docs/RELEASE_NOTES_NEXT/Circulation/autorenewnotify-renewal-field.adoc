New Fields for AutorenewNotify Event Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two new fields, `auto_renewal_remaining`, and `total_renewal_remaining` have
been added to the AutorenewNotify action/trigger event code.  They will
report the number of autorenewals and regular renewals, respectively,
remaining on the new circulation if renewed, or on the old circulation
if not renewed.  This is provided as a convenience to avoid possibly
inaccurate math in the template.  You may access them in the template via
the `udata`:

.................................................
Automatic Renewals Remaining: [% udata.auto_renewal_remaining %]
Total Renewals Remaining: [% udata.total_renewal_remaining %]
.................................................
