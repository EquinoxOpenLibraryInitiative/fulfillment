Course materials module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This version of Evergreen includes an optional course materials module.
Like course reserves modules in other library software, this module
makes reserves collections more discoverable and easier to manage.
The module also provides similar functionality for library electronic
resources and open educational resources, whether they have been
cataloged or not.

To enable the course materials module, go to Administration >
Local Administration > Library Settings Editor. Find the setting
called "Opt Org Unit into the Course Materials Module".  Set it to
True for the org units that want to use the module.

To use the course materials module effectively, staff will need a
new permission called _MANAGE_RESERVES_.  By default, circulation
administrators will receive this permission.

Courses
+++++++

Staff members with the _MANAGE_RESERVES_ permission can create
courses, attach materials to them, attach users to them, and
archive them when they are no longer needed.

When associating physical materials from the catalog to a
course, staff members can choose temporary item attributes.
These attributes will last until the course is archived or
the item is detached from the course, whichever happens
first.

Staff can also choose to associate electronic resources from
the catalog (which must have a transcendent bib source or
a located URI).  They can also create a brief bib record
to attach to the course from within the course materials
module.

Staff members can attach users to the course.  These users
can have either a public role (e.g. instructor) or private
roles (e.g. student).  The public roles will be displayed
in the OPAC.

OPAC
++++

If the module is enabled, the OPAC will include a course search
and a course browse.

Other uses
++++++++++

Libraries may also want to use this module to manage their
displays.  Each display can be treated as a course, and staff
can attach the items they wish to display to the course along
with the temporary attributes (e.g. a shelving location called
"On display").  When the display is over, staff members can
archive the course.
