Test Notification Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Patrons and staff may request a test notification for a patron's default email address or SMS 
number via the Patron Registration interface in the staff client or the Opac preferences interface. The OPAC_LOGIN permissions are required to 
request a notification. When a notification is sent, it will be sent to either the user's default email or default SMS number, depending on 
what was requested.
