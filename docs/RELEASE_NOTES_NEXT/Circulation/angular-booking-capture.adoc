Booking Capture is now in Angular
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The interface to capture resources for booking
reservations has been re-implemented in Angular.
Other booking screens, such as Pick Up and
Manage Reservations, now include an option to 
re-print capture slips.

System administrators can now edit the template
for booking capture slips in Administration ->
Server administration -> Print templates.
