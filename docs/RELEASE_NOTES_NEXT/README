New features should be accompanied by a file in this directory for general
features, infrastructure, performance enhancements or the like, or a
directory below this for area- or "module"-specific additions and changes.

The file should be in asciidoc format and contain enough description to
enable the documentation team to write something coherent about the new
functionality. The name of the file should match the feature. No numbering,
etc. is required. With each release, the contents of this directory will be
appended to the release notes and removed from this directory.

The special file _acknowledgements is meant for acknowledging contributors
to the upcoming version of Evergreen. The names should be cleared in the
master branch at the beginning of each release cycle.
