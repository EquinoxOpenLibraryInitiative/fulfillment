Preloaded Audio Icon and Search Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new search and icon format called Preloaded Audio now exists 
using the following atttributes: itemtype i, item form q.  This 
overlaps with the eAudio format.  If you want to exclude 
preloaded audio from eAudio there is a script in the Administration 
notes to exclude it.
