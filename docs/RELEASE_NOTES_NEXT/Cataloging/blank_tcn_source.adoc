Fix For "Blank" (Empty String) TCN Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously, it was possible for sparsely-populated MARC records to be
saved with a TCN Source of '' (the "empty string"), which caused the
901 $b subfield to be void of data, causing errors when exporting 
MARC records to such third-party programs as Zotero.

A site that has been running without this patch for a long time might want to
check how many bib records they have with an empty tcn_source:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biblio.record_entry WHERE deleted IS FALSE AND tcn_source = '';

Sites can fix the problem by issuing UPDATE statements to set the 901$b to a value
like 'AUTOGEN' or 'Unknown'. They should probably do it per-record, however, to
avoid locking the table in a huge commit.
