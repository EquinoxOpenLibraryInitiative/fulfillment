Combined Aged and Active Circluations Source Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A recent improvement to aid web client data retrieval
speed resulted in a new reports source that was named
nearly identically to a long-existing one, and both
were appearing in the "Core Sources" section of reports.
The newer source has been renamed for clarity and removed
from the core sources to prevent confusion:

 * "Combined Aged and Active circulations" is now named "Combined Aged and Active Circulations (Slim Version)"
   and is removed from the Core Sources.
 * "Combined Aged and Active Circulations", which contains more linkages to other data sources, remains in the 
   Core Sources list.
