Reports Subtotals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reports now allow group subtotals and grand totals.  By checking the
new "Calculate grouping subtotals" checkbox under "Output Options",
a new unlabeled row or column is created with the subtotals for each
grouping and an unlabeled grand total row or column.

This takes advantage of PostreSQL's built-in ROLLUP feature.  See the
PostgreSQL documentation for details: 

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS

An example of a report that could use this new feature is
one based on the Circulation source with the following fields:

 * Circulation -> Checkout / Renewal Library -> Short (Policy) Name (Raw Data)
 * Circulation -> Checkout Date/Time (Year)
 * Circulation -> Shelving Location -> Name (Raw Data)
 * Circulation -> Circ ID (Count Distinct)

Turning on the "Calculate grouping subtotals" checkbox would make
the report show subtotals for each combination of
short name, checkout year, and shelving location name.
