Upgrade notes
-------------

OPAC
~~~~

TPAC library pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen 2.5 introduced the `Library information URL` library setting to
associate a web page with a library. If set, this value was used as the target
of the library link in the copy table on the record details page. However, the
new default behavior is to link to the automatically generated TPAC library
page, which in turn links to the external web site.

If you wish to maintain the previous behavior, you can set the `Use external
library information URL` library setting to `True`.


Disable Autosuggest by Default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1187993, the 
community is aware of ongoing accessibility issues caused through use of 
the autosuggest feature of the Evergreen catalog. The decision has been 
made to disable autosuggest by default for new installations. Existing sites
are cautioned to take note of this change and decide for themselves whether
to discontinue use.

It is possible to disable the autosuggest feature via a global flag. Look in
`Admin -> Server Administration -> Global Flags`, find the `OPAC: Show
auto-completing suggestions dialog...` setting, then edit and uncheck the
`Enabled` box.



Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removal of open-ils.ingest service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The open-ils.ingest service is no longer required, and has been
removed.

You should update your opensrf.xml file to remove references to
open-ils.ingest, and you may also wish to remove the
OpenILS/Application/Ingest.pm file from your Perl @INC path.

In opensrf.xml, remove the entire <open-ils.ingest> element from the
<apps> element, and remove <appname>open-ils.ingest</appname> from
any <activeapps> elements where it is present.

If you have the perldoc command installed, you can use the following
command to locate the path on disk of the Ingest.pm file, which is
no longer required and can be removed:

[source, bash]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
perldoc -l OpenILS::Application::Ingest
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Reporter view 'classic_current_circ' dropped
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As part of the DB upgrade, the reporter view
"reporter.classic_current_circ" was dropped.  If you previously
installed this view from example.reporter-extension.sql, it will
have to be re-installed by executing the "CREATE OR REPLACE
VIEW reporter.classic_current_circ AS..." SQL once again from
example.reporter-extension.sql.



New Features
------------

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add granular settings for requiring staff initials for notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are now three separate library settings for controlling whether staff 
are required to input their initials when creating different types of notes.
See new library settings below.

Any pre-existing library setting for requiring staff initials are preserved 
during the upgrade process. After upgrading, you may choose to change the set
behavior for any of the three new settings.

New Library Settings
+++++++++++++++++++++
 * Require staff initials for entry/edit of patron standing penalties and messages. (ui.staff.require_initials.patron_standing_penalty)
 * Require staff initials for entry/edit of patron notes. (ui.staff.require_initials.patron_info_notes)
 * Require staff initials for entry/edit of copy notes. (ui.staff.require_initials.copy_notes)


Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements to Evergreen's MARC Editor Concerning Fixed Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This work is a combination of two features. One provides suggested
values in a right-click context menus for fixed field values based on
the 'type' of the record being edited. The other provides a wizard to
help specifically with the Physical Characteristics of the record, i.e.
the 007 field.

Right-Click Context Menus
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Users will be able to right-click on the value control for fixed fields
in the MARC Editor, and Evergreen will provide a menu from which the
user can select a possible value. This will work for fixed fields where
Evergreen already contains information from the Library of Congress's
MARC 21 standard.

Example:

image::media/ffer-right-click.png["Right-clicking the BLvl field"]

Evergreen already comes loaded with information from the Library of
Congress's MARC 21 standard on possible values for some fixed fields.

The following table shows which fixed fields for which 'Record Types'
have values already loaded into Evergreen.

---------------------------------------------------------

 Fixed Field |          Record Types
-------------+-----------------------------------
 Audn        | {BKS,COM,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 BLvl        | {BKS,COM,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 Form        | {BKS,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 Lang        | {BKS,COM,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 LitF        | {BKS}
 Type        | {BKS,COM,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}


---------------------------------------------------------

A 'Record Type' is itself a combination of the 'Type of Record' (fixed
field name: Type) and 'Bibliographic Level' (fixed field name: BLvl)
elements of the MARC leader (positions 06 and 07 respectively). You can
see a record's Record Type in the MARC Editor as shown in
this screenshot:

'Record Type':

image::media/ffer-record-type.png["This Record Type is REC"]

A user may add values to these fixed fields as well as to other fixed
fields through the MARC Coded Value Maps interface found under the Admin
-> Server Administration menu in the staff client. These are grouped by
Record Attribute Types (a superset of fixed fields) which have labels
such as 'Alph', 'Biog', 'Videorecording format', and 'Language'.

From LOC Fixed Fields documentation, 'Alph' is 'Original alphabet or
script of title', 'Biog' is 'Biography', 'Videorecording format' is from
the 007 field, 'Language' is positions 35-37 of the 008, and so on.
Other Record Attribute Types such as 'Author' are, of course, not fixed
fields at all.

When users add new values here, the right-click context menus of the
fixed fields in the MARC Editor will include those values.

All values added for any fixed field in the Coded Value Map will display
for any 'Record Type' that uses that fixed field.

Users of the MARC Editor always retain the option of leaving a fixed
field blank, entering the special values # or |, or entering a value not
provided by the right-click context menu.

Physical Characteristics Wizard
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
By right-clicking on an existing or new 007 field in the MARC Editor, users
will be able to enter a wizard that leads them step-by-step through the
positions in that 007 field, telling them the significance of the current
position and providing a drop-down list of possible values.

Launching the Physical Characteristics Wizard:

image::media/ffer-open-wizard.png["Launching the Physical Characteristics Wizard"]

Choosing the Category of Material:

image::media/ffer-007-00.png["Choosing the Category of Material"]

Choosing a value for a later position:

image::media/ffer-007-smd.png["Choosing a value for a later position"]


marc_export script replacement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `/openils/bin/marc_export` script is completely rewritten.  This
new version accepts all of the same command line options as the old
version as well as some new options.

The rewritten `marc_export` talks directly to your Evergreen database
and is a great deal faster than the previous version.  Because the new
script talks directly to the database, it needs to know how to
connect.  To facilitate this, a new option, `--store`, was added that
allows the user to specify one of three Evergreen storage backends to
use when exporting records.  The valid choices are `reporter`,
`cstore`, or `storage`.  The default of `reporter` should work in most
cases, but if you do have a separate reporter database and you know
you want to talk directly to your main production database, then you
will probably want to choose either `cstore` or `storage`.

In addition to the `--store` option, a `--since` option is also added
so that you can specify output of an update file of records changed,
added, and/or deleted since the given date.  The `--since` option uses
a fairly flexible date parser and can accept a wide range of date
formats including ISO 8601, man common date formats such as M/D/Y
(common in the US) or D/Mon/Y (with the first 3 characters or more of
the month spelled out), as well as several less common date formats.
Special date strings such as `yesterday`, `today`, `yesterday week`,
and `today week` are also supported.  For more information see the
VALID DATE FORMATS section of the `Date::Manip::Date` man page.
Available online here:

http://search.cpan.org/~sbeck/Date-Manip-6.42/lib/Date/Manip/Date.pod#VALID_DATE_FORMATS

There is one final difference between the new script and the old
`marc_export`.  The new script does not output progress as it
executes.  Many of the statistics that the script reported are not
readily available to the new script.  It was deemed better to just not
output any progress rather than to output something different from the
old program.  If your scripts parse the output from `marc_export`,
they will need to modified not to expect any.


Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Lost Item Billing: New Min/Max Price Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When an item is marked lost, the user is typically billed for the item.
In Evergreen, they can either be charged the amount recorded in the item
object, or if that value is blank (or zero), charged a default price
(controlled by settings).

In addition to these existing settings, now we can accommodate a range of
prices by saying the patron should be billed at least 'X' and not more
than 'Y'. This also allows you to effectively set a fixed price for all
lost items by setting min and max to the same amount.

New Org Unit Settings
+++++++++++++++++++++
 * Minimum Item Price: circ.min_item_price
 * Maximum Item Price: circ.max_item_price

New Permissions
+++++++++++++++
 * UPDATE_ORG_UNIT_SETTING.circ.min_item_price
 * UPDATE_ORG_UNIT_SETTING.circ.max_item_price


User Editor: "Update Expire Date" button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new button labeled "Update Expire Date" is added in the user
editor next to expire date field. This button can be used to
re-calculate the user's expire date based on the current profile's
permission interval and today's date.

This is similar to how the expire date is populated when creating a
new user, or when changing the profile group.

This button simplifies the process of "renewing" a user, by
eliminating the requirement that staff manually enter a new expire
date.

A button is used here so that the updating of the expire date
remains an  intentional process, not one that happens upon any edit.


OPAC
~~~~

Composite Record Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With this feature we create an abstraction on top of the Record Attribute
infrastructure to allow the aggregation of multiple, cross-Attribute values
under a single search filter value, accessible through new, dynamic filters.

Each QueryParser filter will be created by the addition of a Composite Record
Attribute Definition. For instance, one may wish to create a Composite Record
Attribute Definition for an abstract "Item Type" interface component that
uses information from the item_type, vr_format, bib_level and item_form
Record Attribute Definitions, with each Composite Record Attribute Value
having a different combination of Record Attribute Values from some or all of
these Record Attribute Definitions. In this way, as single interface
component might be presented as a dropdown with options such as "All Books",
"All video recordings", "DVDs", "VHS Tapes", "E-Books", "Audio Books" and
"Large Print Books". Of particular note are the "DVDs" and "VHS Tapes"
entries, which include information from Record Attribute Definitions
completely separate from the others. Additionally, the Composite Record
Attribute Values defined by this Composite Record Attribute Definition
can be used to drive behavioral logic, such as alternate icon display or
link generation, in upgrade-friendly template adjustments.

Included in this development is a replacement for the single-attribute
Format filter supplied for basic search.  Instead, a Composite Attribute
is used to combine the values from Item Type, Item Form and Videorecording
Format in various ways that provide a more patron-friendly set of choices.

This new Format filter can be adjusted, or even replaced with a completely
local one, through configuration and without template adjustment.



Located URI visibility options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before this, Evergreen restricted the visibility of bibliographic records
that make use of Located URIs in a way that attempts to model licensing
restrictions.

There now exists a global flag to allow sites the option of changing the
behaviour of Located URIs so that they act in a way analogous to copies
for visibility testing.  When the opac.located_uri.act_as_copy global flag
is enabled, Located URIs will cause their containing bib records to become
visible in searches where the URI is in scope to either ancestors of the
search library, as before, or descendants of the search library, as copies
do.  As before, if a preferred library is supplied by the user, it is
added to the list of visible org units to check.

Additionally, while the underlying UnAPI and supporting code was capable
of providing a reasonable and logical sort order for the Located URIs when
embedded as XML holdings elements, the client-facing UnAPI method was not
making use of that.  It now does, and uses the same sorting algorithm as
is used for copies.


Multi-valued Record Attributes and Controlled Record Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Having identified common use cases and reasonable restrictions that can be
placed on the feature set, we have extended the Record Attribute
infrastructure to support both the extraction and storage of all instances
of a defined Attribute found within a bibliographic record, as well as
provide new and more powerful indexing of existing data, in several ways.

Record Attributes can now be defined by configuration as either single-valued
or multi-valued. For any Attribute configured as single-valued, only the
first value extracted from a record will be stored. This configuration
parameter and restriction is in place to support potential query
optimizations based on foreknowledge of whether a given Attribute is multi-
valued or not.

Record Attributes will be defined by configuration as either controlled or
uncontrolled. A controlled Record Attribute is one that has entries in the
Coded Value Map infrastructure specifying the valid values the record may
carry for this attribute. If defined as a controlled Attribute, any unknown
values extracted from a record will be ignored. Uncontrolled Attributes,
however, may contain any value. This configuration parameter and restriction
also supports potential query optimization.

We store uncontrolled attribute values in a new table with a monotonically
decreasing ID sequence, separating it from controlled values, reducing storage
requirements by retaining only unique values, and making lookup faster.

Restrictions
++++++++++++
 * A Record Attribute's values must match Coded Value Map entries if it is to be a Controlled Attribute. Coded Value Map control is indicated by a new "controlled" boolean on the config.record_attr_definition table.
 * Record Attributes must "opt in" to multi-valued-ness. Record Attributes will opt in via a new "multi" boolean on config.record_attr_definition; this restriction enforces site config requirements by being explicit about the definition of "multi" fields.
 * If controlled but not opt'd in to multi-mode, only the first value will be recorded but the new search mechanism will be used.
 * Only single-valued Record Attributes will be available for use by the system as Sort Axes.
 * Only controlled Record Attributes will be available for use by the TPAC as dynamically generated filter UI components, such as filter dropdowns or multi-selects.

New External Dependency
+++++++++++++++++++++++
This new feature requires the addition of the intarray extension to Postgres.
This is a stock extension available on most linux distributions via the same
package as the already-required plperl extension.


Restore OpenSearch Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Restore previously held functionality from JSPAC to support OpenSearch in TPAC. 
This allows users to easily add the Evergreen search engine to their browser's 
built-in set of search engines.


Accepting payments with Stripe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Stripe is a payment processing service that lets
sites take credit card payments without payment card information ever
touching the sites' own servers.

NOTE: Using Stripe as a payment processor means that clients *must*
have Javascript enabled in order to submit fine payments through your
OPAC.

Library Settings
++++++++++++++++
The following settings need to be set at the appropriate org level for
sites wanting to use Stripe.

 * "Allow Credit Card Payments" (should be 'true')

   credit.payments.allow

 * "Enable Stripe payments" (should be 'true')

   credit.processor.stripe.enabled

 * "Stripe publishable key" (value provided by Stripe)

   credit.processor.stripe.pubkey

 * "Stripe secret key" (value provided by Stripe)

   credit.processor.stripe.secretkey

 * "Name default credit processor" (should be 'Stripe')

   credit.processor.default


TPAC library pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature adds one web page per library in the system to the TPAC at
`http://hostname/eg/opac/library/<SHORTNAME>` and
`http://hostname/eg/opac/library/<ID>`. The pages publish the following
information from Evergreen (if available):

* Name of the library
* Link to the library web site (from `Library Information URL` library setting)
* Opening hours
* Email address
* Phone number
* Mailing address
* Link to parent library (if applicable)

Library pages are linked from the copy table on the record details page.

Structured data
+++++++++++++++
The library web pages publish schema.org structured data, which can enable
search engines and other systems to better understand your libraries and their
resources.


TPAC Metarecord Search and Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature adds support for searching and placing holds against 
metarecords.

Metarecord Searching
++++++++++++++++++++
In the top search bar and in the advanced search page, there is a new
search modifier labeled "Group Formats and Editions".  When selected,
searches are performed against metarecords and metarecords are shown
in the results list.

For each metarecord, format icons for all constituent records are shown.
When a use clicks on a metarecord, if the metarecord has multiple
constituent records, the user is taken to the constituent records
list.  Similarly, when a metarecord only has one constituent record,
the user is directed to the record detail page for the constituent
record.

Metarecord Holds
++++++++++++++++
Clicking the place hold link from the metarecord results page shows
the available formats and languages for the metarecord, allowing
the user to limit the scope of the hold.  Non-metarecord holds now
get a new "Advanced Holds Options" link which allows user to promote
a title hold to a metarecord hold, thus providing access 
to the formats / editions selector, before the hold is placed.

In the My Account holds list, icons for all selected formats are 
displayed in the Format columns for the hold.  When editing a 
metarecord hold, users may modify the desired formats and languages.

Configuration
+++++++++++++
Admins may disable this feature by un-commenting the "metarecord.disabled"
attribute in config.tt2


Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Compliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To make the catalog more accessible to users with a range of disabilities,
including blindness and low vision, the catalog has been revised to better
comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These
revisions target level "AA" of compliance.

For more information on WCAG, see http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag


Bug Fixes
---------

IMPORTANT SECURITY INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A serious security flaw that allows unauthorized remote access to
organizational unit settings is fixed in the following releases of
Evergreen: 2.5.9, 2.6.7, and 2.7.4.  All prior releases of Evergreen
are vulnerable to exploitation of this flaw to reveal sensitive system
information.  If you are running a vulnerable release of Evergreen you
are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade to a non-vulnerable release as
soon as possible.

Set resource limits for Clark Kent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several parameters are now available for the reporter daemon process
(`clark-kent.pl`) to control resource usage.  These can be used to
reduce the chances that a malformed report can cause indigestion
on a database or reports server.  The new parameters, which can be
set in `opensrf.xml` or as command-line switches for `clark-kent.pl` are

* `//reporter/setup/statement_timeout` / `--statement-timeout`

Number of minutes to allow a report's underlying SQL query
to run before it gets cancelled.  Default value is
60 minutes.  If a report's query gets cancelled, the
error_text value will be set to a valid that indicates that
the allowed time was exceeded.

* `//reporter/setup/max_rows_for_charts` / `--max-rows-for-charts`

Number of rows permitted in the query's output before
Clark Kent refuses to attempt to draw a graph. Default
value is 1,000 rows.

* `//reporter/setup/resultset_limit` / `--resultset-limit`

If set, truncates the report's output to the specified
number of hits.  Note that it will not be apparent
to a staff user if the report's output has been
truncated.  Default value is unlimited.

The report concurrency (i.e., the number of reports that Clark
Kent will run in parallel) can now also be controlled via
the `opensrf.xml` setting `//reporter/setup/parallel`.
