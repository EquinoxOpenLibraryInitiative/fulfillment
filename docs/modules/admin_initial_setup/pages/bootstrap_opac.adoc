= Bootstrap-based OPAC =

Evergreen includes an experimental OPAC with a cleaner, more modern design.

To enable the new OPAC design, open the `/etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf` file.

Find the following line:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates"
----

Add the following line directly below it:

----
PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates-bootstrap"
----

Be sure that, if you have any local customizations, that they are referenced below
this line.  This way, your customizations will still appear in the new OPAC design
(although they may need to be adjusted to better fit the new style).

You can also turn on the new OPAC for some virtual hosts only, by adding it to the
appropriate virtual host entry.  Be sure to reference the OILSWebTemplatePath for
the `templates-bootstrap` directory before referencing any local customizations
used by that virtual host.
