== Introduction ==

Acquisitions allows you to order materials, track the expenditure of your
collections funds, track invoices and set up policies for manual claiming. In
this chapter, we're going to be describing how to use the most essential
functions of acquisitions in the Evergreen system.

== When should libraries use acquisitions? ==
* When you want to track spending of your collections budget.
* When you want to use Evergreen to place orders electronically with your
  vendors.
* When you want to import large batches of records to quickly get your on-order
  titles into the system.

If your library simply wants to add on-order items to the catalog so that
patrons can view and place holds on titles that have not yet arrived,
acquisitions may be more than you need. Adding those on-order records via
cataloging is a simpler option that works well for this use case.

Below are the basic administrative settings to be configured to get started
with acquisitions. At a minimum, a library must configure *Funding Sources*,
*Funds*, and *Providers* to use acquisitions.

== Managing Funds ==

=== Funding Sources (Required) ===
Funding sources allow you to specify the sources that contribute monies to your
fund(s). You can create as few or as many funding sources as you need. These
can be used to track exact amounts for accounts in your general ledger.

Example funding sources might be:

* A municipal allocation for your materials budget;
* A trust fund used for collections;
* A revolving account that is used to replace lost materials;
* Grant funds to be used for collections.

Funding sources are not tied to fiscal or calendar years, so you can continue
to add money to the same funding source over multiple years, e.g. County
Funding. Alternatively, you can name funding sources by year, e.g. County
Funding 2010 and County Funding 2011, and apply credits each year to the
matching source.

. To create a funding source, select *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration ->
  Funding Sources*. Click the *New Funding Source* button. Give
  the funding source a name, an owning library, and code. You should also
  identify the type of currency that is used for the fund.
. You must add money to the funding source before you can use it. Click the
  hyperlinked name of the funding source and then click the *Apply Credit*
  button. Add the amount of funds you need to add. The *Note* field is optional.

=== Funds (Required) ===
Funds allow you to allocate credits toward specific purchases. They typically
are used to track spending and purchases for specific collections. Some
libraries may choose to define very broad funds for their collections (e.g.
children's materials, adult materials) while others may choose to define more
specific funds (e.g. adult non-fiction DVDs for BR1).

If your library does not wish to track fund accounting, you can create one
large generic fund and use that fund for all of your purchases.

. To create a fund, select *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration ->
  Funds*. Click the *New Fund* button. Give the fund a name and code.
. The *Year* can either be the fiscal or calendar year for the fund.
. If you are a multi-branch library that will be ordering titles for multiple
  branches, you should select the system as the owning *Org Unit*, even if this
  fund will only be used for collections at a specific branch. If you are a
  one-branch library or if your branches do their own ordering, you can select
  the branch as the owning *Org Unit*.
. Select the *Currency Type* that will be used for this fund.
. You must select the *Active* checkbox to use the fund.
. Enter a *Balance Stop Percent*. The balance stop percent prevents you from
  making purchases when only a specified amount of the fund remains. For example,
  if you want to spend 95 percent of your funds, leaving a five percent balance
  in the fund, then you would enter 95 in the field. When the fund reaches its
  balance stop percent, it will appear in red when you apply funds to copies.
. Enter a *Balance Warning Percent*. The balance warning percent gives you a
  warning that the fund is low. You can specify any percent. For example, if you
  want to spend 90 percent of your funds and be warned when the fund has only 10
  percent of its balance remaining, then enter 90 in the field. When the fund
  reaches its balance warning percent, it will appear in yellow when you apply
  funds to copies.
. Check the *Propagate* box to propagate funds. When you propagate a fund, the
  system will create a new fund for the following fiscal year with the same
  parameters as your current fund. All of the settings transfer except for the
  year and the amount of money in the fund. Propagation occurs during the fiscal
  year close-out operation.
. Check the *Rollover* box if you want to roll over remaining encumbrances and
  funds into the same fund next year. If you need the ability to roll over
  encumbrances without rolling over funds, go to the *Library Settings Editor*
  (*Administration -> Local Administration ->  Library Settings Editor*) and set *Allow
  funds to be rolled over without bringing the money along* to *True*.
. You must add money to the fund before you can begin using it. Click the
  hyperlinked name of the fund. Click the *Create Allocation button*. Select a
  *Funding Source* from which the allocation will be drawn and then enter an
  amount for the allocation. The *Note* field is optional.

=== Fund Tags (Optional) ===
You can apply tags to funds so that you can group funds for easy reporting. For
example, you have three funds for childrenâ€™s materials: Children's Board Books,
Children's DVDs, and Children's CDs. Assign a fund tag of children's to each
fund. When you need to report on the amount that has been spent on all
children's materials, you can run a report on the fund tag to find total
expenditures on children's materials rather than reporting on each individual
fund.

. To create a fund tag, select *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration ->
  Fund Tags*. Click the *New Fund Tag* button. Select a owning library and
  add the name for the fund tag.
. To apply a fund tag to a fund, select *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration ->
  Funds*. Click on the hyperlinked name for the fund. Click the
  *Tags* tab and then click the *Add Tag* button. Select the tag from the
  dropdown menu.

For convenience when propagating or rolling over a fund for a new fiscal year,
fund tags will be copied from the current fund to the new year's fund.

== Ordering ==

=== Providers (Required) ===
Providers are the vendors from whom you order titles.

. To add a provider record,  select *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration ->
  Providers*. Alternatively, you can access this from *Acquisitions -> Provider Search*.
. Enter information about the provider. At a minimum, you need to add a
  *Provider Name*, *Code*, *Owner*, and *Currency*. You also need to select the
  *Active* checkbox to use the provider.

=== Distribution Formulas (Optional) ===
If you are ordering for a multi-branch library system, distribution formulas
are a useful way to specify the number of items that should be distributed to
specific branches and item locations.

. To create a distribution formula, select *Administration -> Acquisitions
  Administration -> Distribution Formulas*. Click the *New Formula* button. Enter
  the formula name and select the owning library. Ignore the *Skip Count* field.
. Click *New Entry*. Select an Owning Library from the drop down menu. This
  indicates the branch that will receive the items.
. Select a Shelving Location from the drop down menu.
. In the Item Count field, enter the number of items that should be distributed
  to that branch and copy location. You can enter the number or use the arrows on
  the right side of the field.
. Keep adding entries until the distribution formula is complete.

=== Helpful acquisitions Library Settings ===
There are several acquisitions Library Settings available that will help with
acquisitions workflow. These settings can be found at *Administration -> Local
Administration -> Library Settings Editor*.

* Default circulation modifier - Automatically applies a default circulation
  modifier to all of your acquisitions items. Useful if you use a specific
  circulation modifier for on-order items.
* Default copy location - Automatically applies a default item location (e.g.
  On Order) to acquisitions items.
* Temporary barcode prefix - Applies a unique prefix to the barcode that is
  automatically generated during the acquisitions process.
* Temporary call number prefix - Applies a unique prefix to the start of the
  call number that is automatically generated during the acquisitions process.

=== Preparing for order record loading ===
If your library is planning to upload order records in a batch, you need to add
some information to your provider records so that Evergreen knows how to map
the item data contained in the order record.

. Retrieve the record for the provider that has supplied the order records by
  selecting *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Providers*. Alternatively, you can access this from *Acquisitions -> Provider Search*. 
. Double-click the Provider name in the results grid to retrieve the Provider.
. Select the *Holdings Definitions* tab.
. Add the MARC tag that contains your holdings data in the
  *Holdings Tag* field.
. To map the tag's subfields to the appropriate copy data, select the *New Holding
  Subfield* button.  Add the appropriate subfield and name, and select *Save*.
. If your vendor is sending other data in a MARC tag that needs to be mapped to
a field in acquisitions, you can do so by selecting the *Attribute Definitions*
tab. As an example, if you need to import the PO Name, you could set up an
attribute definition by adding an XPath similar to:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code => purchase_order
xpath => //*[@tag="962"]/*[@code="p"]
Is Identifier => false
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
where 962 is the holdings tag and p is the subfield that contains the PO Name.

=== Preparing to send electronic orders from Evergreen ===
If your library wants to transmit electronic order information to a vendor, you
will need to configure your server to use EDI. You need to install the EDI
translator and EDI scripts on your server by following the instructions in the
command line system administration manual.

Configure your provider's EDI information by selecting *Administration -> 
Acquisitions Administration -> EDI Accounts*. Alternatively, you can add a new EDI Account from the *EDI* tab in the Provider Details interface. Click *New EDI Account* Button. Give the
account a name in the *Label* box.

. *Host* is the vendor-assigned FTP/SFTP/SSH hostname.
. *Username* is the vendor-assigned FTP/SFTP/SSH username.
. *Password* is the vendor-assigned FTP/SFTP/SSH password.
. *Account* This field enables you to add a supplemental password for
  entry to a remote system after log in has been completed. This field is
  optional for the ILS but may be required by your provider.
. *Owner* is the organizational unit who owns the EDI account
. *Last Activity* is the date of last activity for the account
. *Provider* is a link to the codes for the Provider record.
. *Path* is the path on the vendorâ€™s server where Evergreen will deposit its
  outgoing order files.
. *Incoming Directory* is the path on the vendorâ€™s server where Evergreen
  will retrieve incoming order responses and invoices.
. *Vendor Account Number* is the Vendor assigned account number.
. *Vendor Assigned Code* is usually a sub-account designation. It can be used
  with or without the Vendor Account Number.

You now need to add this *EDI Account* and the *SAN* code to the provider's record.

. Select *Administration -> Acquisitions Administration -> Providers*. Alternatively, you can access this from *Acquisitions -> Provider Search*.
. Double-click the Provider name in the results grid to retrieve the Provider.
. Select the account you just created in the *EDI Default* field.
. Add the vendor-provided SAN code to the *SAN* field.
. Select *Save* to save your changes.

The last step is to add your library's SAN code to Evergreen.

. Select *Administration -> Server Administration ->  Organizational Units*.
. Select your library from the organizational hierarchy in the left pane.
. Click the *Addresses* tab and add your library's SAN code to the *SAN* field.
