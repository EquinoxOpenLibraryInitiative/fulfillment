= Troubleshooting TPAC errors =
:toc:

If there is a problem such as a TT syntax error, it generally shows up as an
ugly server failure page. If you check the Apache error logs, you will probably
find some solid clues about the reason for the failure. For example, in the
following example, the error message identifies the file in which the problem
occurred as well as the relevant line numbers.

Example error message in Apache error logs:

----
