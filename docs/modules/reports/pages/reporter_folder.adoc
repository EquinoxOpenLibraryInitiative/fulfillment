There are three main components to reports: _Templates_, _Reports_, and _Output_. 
Each of these components must be stored in a folder. Folders can be private 
(accessible to your login only) or shared with other staff at your library, 
other libraries in your system or consortium. It is also possible to selectively 
share 
only certain folders and/or subfolders.

There are two parts to the folders pane. The _My Folders_ section contains folders 
created with your Evergreen account. Folders that other users have shared with 
you appear in the _Shared Folders_ section under the username of the sharing 
account.

== Creating Folders ==


indexterm:[reports, folders, creating]

Whether you are creating a report from scratch or working from a shared template 
you must first create at least one folder.

The steps for creating folders are similar for each reporting function. It is 
easier to create folders for templates, reports, and output all at once at the 
beginning, though it is possible to do it before each step. This example 
demonstrates creating a folder for a template.

. Click on _Templates_ in the _My Folders_ section.
. Name the folder. Select _Share_ or _Do not share_ from the dropdown menu.
. If you want to share your folder, select who you want to share this folder 
with from the dropdown menu.
. Click _Create Sub Folder_.
. Click _OK_.
. Next, create a folder for the report definition to be saved to. Click on 
_Reports_.
. Repeat steps 2-5 to create a Reports folder also called _Circulation_.
. Finally, you need to create a folder for the reportâ€™s output to be saved in. 
Click on _Output_.
. Repeat steps 2-5 to create an Output folder named _Circulation_.


TIP: Using a parallel naming scheme for folders in Templates, Reports, 
and Output helps keep your reports organized and easier to find

The folders you just created will now be visible by clicking the arrows in _My 
Folders_. Bracketed after the folder name is whom the folder is shared with. For 
example, _Circulation (BNCLF)_ is shared with the North Coast Library Federation. 
If it is not a shared folder there will be nothing after the folder name. You 
may create as many folders and sub-folders as you like.

== Managing Folders ==

Once a folder has been created you can change the name, delete it, create a new 
subfolder, or change the sharing settings. This example demonstrates changing a 
folder name; the other choices follow similar steps

. Click on the folder that you wish to rename.
. Click _Manage Folder_.
. Select _Change folder name_ from the dropdown menu and click _Go_.
. Enter the new name and click _Submit_.
. Click _OK_.
. You will get a confirmation box that the _Action Succeeded_. Click _OK_.
