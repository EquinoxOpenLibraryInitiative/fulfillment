Evergreen can provide CGI authentication for EZProxy.
To enable this, you will need to:

. Add a new User Activity Type to Evergreen for EZProxy CGI authentications.
. Add a new Remote Authentication Profile to Evergreen. You will probably want
to use `EZProxyCGI` as the name.
. Edit the `<Location /api/ezproxy>` stanza in Evergreen's eg_vhost configuration
file. In particular, you will need to allow access to from your EZProxy server,
fill in the base uri of your EZProxy server, and add a secret to the
_OILSRemoteAuthEZProxySecret_ variable.
. Restart Apache.
. Edit the EZProxy user.txt file.  You will likely want to add a stanza such
as the following:

.Sample user.txt stanza
----
::CGI=http://your-evergreen-catalog.com/api/ezproxy?url=^R
::Ticket
MD5 <same secret as in eg_vhost config>
Expired; Deny expiredticket.htm
/Ticket
----

When this feature is enabled, users will see an Evergreen-based login screen.
You may customize the look and feel of this login screen by editing the relevant
template toolkit files.
