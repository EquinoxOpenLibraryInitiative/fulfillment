=== Setting regular library hours ===

You may do this in _Administration_ > _Server Administration_ > _Organizational
Units_.

The *Hours of Operation* tab is where you enter regular, weekly hours. Holiday
and other closures are set in the *Closed Dates Editor*. Hours of operation and
closed dates impact due dates and fine accrual.
