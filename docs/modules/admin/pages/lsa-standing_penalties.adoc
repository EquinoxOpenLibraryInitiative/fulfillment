:toc:

In versions of Evergreen prior to 2.3, the following penalty types were
available by default.  When applied to user accounts, these penalties prevented
users from completing the following actions: 

* *CIRC* - Users cannot check out items
* *HOLD* - Users cannot place holds on items
* *RENEW* - Users cannot renew items

In version 2.3, two new penalty types are available in Evergreen: 

* *CAPTURE* - This penalty prevents a user's holds from being captured. If the
_HOLD_ penalty has not been applied to a user's account, then the patron can place a
hold, but the targeted item will not appear on a pull list and will not be
captured for a hold if it is checked in.
* *FULFILL* - This penalty prevents a user from checking out an item that is on
hold.  If the _HOLD_ and _CAPTURE_ penalties have not been applied to a user's
account, then the user can place a hold on an item, and the item can be captured
for a hold.  However, when he tries to check out the item, the circulator will
see a pop up box with the name of the penalty type, _FULFILL_.  The circulator
must correct the problem with the account or must override the penalty to check
out the item.
