=== Setting limits on allowed payment amounts ===

Two new settings have been added to prevent library staff
from accidentally clearing all patron bills by scanning a
barcode into the Payment Amount field, or accidentally
entering the amount without a decimal point (such as you
would when using a cash register).

Both settings are available via the Library Settings Editor.
The Payment amount threshold for Are You Sure? dialog
(`ui.circ.billing.amount_warn`) setting identifies the amount
above which staff will be asked if they're sure they want
to apply the payment. The Maximum payment amount allowed
(`ui.circ.billing.amount_limit`) setting identifies the
maximum amount of money that can be accepted through the
staff client.

These settings only affect the staff client, not credit
cards accepted through the public catalog, or direct API
calls from third party tools.
