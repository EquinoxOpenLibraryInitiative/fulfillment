== Expanding the Work Log ==

The Work Log records checkins, checkouts, patron registration, patron editing, renewals, payments and holds placed from with the patron record for a given login. 

To access the Work Log go to *Administration* -> *Local Administration* ->  *Work Log*. 

There are two seperate logs, *Most Recently Logged Staff Actions* and *Most Recently Affected patrons*. The *Most Recently Logged Staff Actions* logs the the transactions in order they have occured on the workstation.  The *Most Recently Affected Patrons* log is a listing of the last patrons that transactions happened on. 

The Work Log can contain a maximum number of transactions, this number is set via the xref:admin:librarysettings.adoc[Library Settings Editor]. They are in the GUI group of settings. *Work Log: Maximum Actions Logged* effects the number of transactions listing under the *Most Recently Logged Staff Actions* and *Work Log: Maximum Patrons Logged* limits the number of patrons that are listed in the log.
