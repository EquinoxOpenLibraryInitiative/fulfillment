== Introduction ==

Evergreen responds to OpenSearch requests. This can be a good way to get
search results delivered in a format that you prefer.

Throughout this section, replace `<hostname>` with the domain or subdomain
of your Evergreen installation to try these examples on your own system.

Opensearch queries will be in the format
`http://<hostname>/opac/extras/opensearch/1.1/-/html-full?searchTerms=item_type(r)&searchClass=keyword&count=25`

In this example,

* html-full is the format you would like.  html-full is a good view for troubleshooting your query.
* searchTerms is a url-encoded search query.  You can use limiters in the `limiter(value)` format.
For example, you can use a query like `item_lang(spa)`
* count is the number of results per page.  The default is 10, and the maximum is 25.

Other options include:

* searchSort and searchSortDir, which can be used to display the results in a different order (e.g. for an RSS feed).
