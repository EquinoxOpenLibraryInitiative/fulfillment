== Introduction ==

The Acquisitions Load MARC Order Record interface enables you to add MARC
records to selection lists and purchase orders and upload the records into the
catalog.  You can both create and activate purchase orders in one step from this
interface. You can also load bibs and items into the catalog.

Leveraging the match sets available in the cataloging MARC batch Import
interface, you can also utilize record matching mechanisms to prevent the
creation of duplicate records. 

For detailed instructions on record matching and importing, see
the cataloging manual.

== Basic Upload Options ==
. Click *Acquisitions* -> *Load MARC Order Records*.
. If you want to upload the MARC records to a new purchase order, then
check _Create Purchase Order_.
. If you want to activate the purchase order at the time of creation, then
check _Activate Purchase Order_.
. Enter the name of the *Provider*. The text will auto-complete.
. Select an org unit from the drop down menu. The context org unit is the org
unit responsible for placing and managing the order. It defines what org unit
settings (eg copy locations) are in scope, what fiscal year to use, who is
allowed to view/modify the PO, where the items should be delivered and the EDI
SAN. In the case of a multi-branch system uploading records for multiple
branches, choosing the system is probably best. Single branch libraries or 
branches responsible for their own orders should probably select the branch.
. If you want to upload the records to a selection list, you can select a list
from the drop down menu, or type in the name of the selection list that you
want to create.
. Select a *Fiscal Year* from the dropdown menu that matches the fiscal year
of the funds that will be used for the order. If no fiscal year is selected, the
system will use the organizational unit's default fiscal year stored in the
database. If not fiscal year is set, the system will default to the current
calendar year.

== Record Matching Options ==
Use the options below the horizontal rule for the system to check for matching
records before importing an order record.

. Create a queue to which you can upload your records, or add you records to an existing queue
. Select a *Record Match Set* from the drop-down menu.
. Select a *Merge Profile.* Merge profiles enable you to specify which tags
should be removed or preserved in incoming records.
. Select a *Record Source* from the drop-down menu.
. If you want to automatically import records on upload, select one or more of
the following options.
  .. *Import Non-Matching Records* - import any records that don't have a match
  in the system.
  .. *Merge on Exact Match (901c)* - use only for records that will match on
  the 901c field.
  .. *Merge on Single Match* - import records that only have one match in the
  system.
  .. *Merge on Best Match* - If more than one match is found in the catalog for
  a given record, Evergreen will attempt to perform the best match as defined
  by the match score.
. To only import records that have a quality equal to or greater than the
existing record, enter a *Best/Single Match Minimum Quality Ratio*.  Divide the
incoming record quality score, as determined by the match set's quality
metrics, by the record quality score of the best match that exists in the 
catalog. If you want to ensure that the inbound record is only imported when it
has a higher quality than the best match, then you must enter a ratio that is
higher than 1, such as 1.1. If you want to bypass all quality restraints, enter
a 0 (zero) in this field.
. Select an *Insufficient Quality Fall-Through Profile* if desired. This field
enables you to indicate that if the inbound record does not meet the
configured quality standards, then you may still import the record using an
alternate merge profile. This field is typically used for selecting a merge
profile that allows the user to import holdings attached to a lower quality
record without replacing the existing (target) record with the incoming record.
This field is optional.
. If your order records contain holdings information, by default, Evergreen 
will load them as acquisitions copies. (Note: These can be overlayed with real copies
during the MARC batch importing process.) Or you can select *Load Items for
Imported Records* to load them as live copies that display in the catalog.

== Sticky Settings ==

== Use Cases for MARC Order Upload form ==

You can add items to a selection list or purchase order and ignore the record 
matching options, or you can use both acquisitions and cataloging functions. In
these examples, you will use both functions.

*Example 1*
Using the Acquisitions MARC Batch Load interface, upload MARC records to a
selection list and import queue, and match queued records with existing catalog
records.

In this example, an acquisitions librarian has received a batch of MARC records
from a vendor. She will add the records to a selection list and a Vandelay
record queue.

A cataloger will later view the queue, edit the records, and import them into
the catalog.

. Click *Acquisitions -> Load MARC Order Records*
. Add MARC order records to a *Selection list* and/or a *Purchase Order.* 
Check the box to create a purchase order if desired.
. Select a *Provider* from the drop-down menu, or begin typing the code for the provider, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Context Org Unit* from the drop down-menu, or begin typing the code
for the context org unit, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Selection List* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the name
of the selection list.  You can create a new list, or the field will auto-fill.
. Create a new record import queue, or upload the records to an existing
queue.
. Select a *Record Match Set*.
. Browse your computer to find the MARC file, and click *Upload*.

. The processed items appear at the bottom of the screen.

image::media/Vandelay_Integration_into_Acquisitions2.jpg[Vandelay_Integration_into_Acquisitions2]
. You can click the link(s) to access the selection list or the import queue.
Click the link to *View Selection List*.
. Look at the first line item.  The line item has not yet been linked to the
catalog, but it is linked to a record import queue.  Click the link to the
*queue* to examine the MARC record.

. The batch import interface opens in a new tab.  The bibliographic records
appear in the queue. Records that have matches are identified in the queue. You
can edit these records and/or import them into the catalog, completing the
process.

*Example 2*: Using the Acquisitions MARC Batch Load interface, upload MARC
records to a selection list, and use the Vandelay options to import the records
directly into the catalog.  The Vandelay options will enable you to match
incoming records with existing catalog records.

In this example, a librarian will add MARC records to a selection list, create
criteria for matching incoming and existing records, and import the matching
and non-matching records into the catalog.

. Click *Acquisitions* -> *Load MARC Order Records*
. Add MARC order records to a *Selection list* and/or a *Purchase Order.* 
Check the box to create a purchase order if desired.
. Select a *Provider* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the code for the
provider, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Context Org Unit* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the code for the context org unit, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Selection List* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the name
of the selection list.  You can create a new list, or the field will auto-fill.
. Create a new record import queue, or upload the records to an existing queue.
. Select a *Record Match Set*.
. Select *Merge Profile* -> *Match-Only Merge*.
. Check the boxes adjacent to *Import Non-Matching Records* and *Merge on Best
Match*.
.  Browse your computer to find the MARC file, and click *Upload*.

+
. Click the link to *View Selection List*  Line items that do not match
existing catalog records on title and ISBN contain the link, *link to catalog*.
This link indicates that you could link the line item to a catalog record, but
currently, no match exists between the line item and catalog records.  Line
items that do have matching records in the catalog contain the link, *catalog*.

. Click the *catalog* link to view the line item in the catalog.

*Permissions to use this Feature*

IMPORT_MARC - Using batch importer to create new bib records requires the
IMPORT_MARC permission (same as open-ils.cat.biblio.record.xml.import). If the
permission fails, the queued record will fail import and be stamped with a new
"import.record.perm_failure" import error

IMPORT_ACQ_LINEITEM_BIB_RECORD_UPLOAD -  This allows interfaces leveraging 
the batch importer, such as Acquisitions, to create a higher barrier to entry.
This permission prevents users from creating new bib records directly from the
ACQ vendor MARC file upload interface.
