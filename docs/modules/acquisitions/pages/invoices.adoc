=== Adding line items from a Purchase Order or search results screen to an invoice ===

You can create an invoice or add line items to an invoice directly from a
Purchase Order or an acquisitions search results screen. 

. Place a checkmark in the box for selected line items from the Purchase Order' or acquisitions search results page.
. If you are creating a new invoice, click _Actions_ -> _Create Invoice From
Selected Line Items_.  Enter the invoice information in the top half of the
screen.
. If you are adding the line items to an existing invoice, click _Actions_ ->
_Link Selected Line Items to Invoice_. Enter the Invoice # and Provider and
then click the _Link_ button.
. Evergreen automatically enters the number of items that was ordered in
the # Invoiced and # Paid fields. Adjust these quantities as needed.
. Enter the amount that the organization was billed. This entry will
automatically propagate to the Paid field.
. You have the option to add charge types if applicable. Charge types are
additional charges that can be selected from the drop-down menu. Common charge
types include taxes and handling fees.
. You have four options for saving an invoice.

- Click _Save_ to save the changes you have made while staying in the current
invoice.
- Click _Save & Clear_ to save the changes you have made and to replace the 
current invoice with a new invoice so that you can continue invoicing items.
- Click _Prorate_ to save the invoice and prorate any additional charges, such
as taxes, across funds, if multiple funds have been used to pay the invoice.

+
[NOTE]
Prorating will only be applied to charge types that have the _Prorate?_ flag set
to true. This setting can be adjusted via _Administration_ ->
_Acquisitions Administration_ -> _Invoice Item Types_.
+

- Click _Close_. Choose this option when you have completed the invoice. This
option will also save any changes that have been made.  Funds will be disencumbered when the invoice is closed.

link appears at the bottom of a closed invoice.

=== Search for line items from an invoice ===

indexterm:[acquisitions,lineitems,searching for]
indexterm:[acquisitions,invoices,searching for lineitems]

You can open an invoice, search for line items from
the invoice, and add your search results to a new or existing invoice.  This
feature is especially useful when you want to populate an invoice with line
items from multiple purchase orders.

In this example, we'll add line items to a new invoice:

indexterm:[acquisitions,lineitems,adding]

. Click _Acquisitions_ -> _Create Invoice_.
. An invoice summary appears at the top of the invoice and includes the number
of line items on the invoice and the expected cost of the items.  This number
will change as we add line items to the invoice.
. Enter the invoice details (optional).  If you do not enter the invoice
details, then Evergreen will populate the _Provider_ and _Receiver_ fields with
information from the line items.  
+
NOTE: If you do not want to display the details, click _Hide Details_.
+
image::media/Search_for_line_items_from_an_invoice1.jpg[Search_for_line_items_from_an_invoice1]
+
. Click the _Search_ tab to add line items to an invoice.
. Select your search criteria from the drop-down menu.  
. On the right side of the screen, _Limit to Invoiceable Items_ is checked by
default.  Invoiceable items are those that are on order, have not been
cancelled, and have not yet been invoiced.  Evergreen also filters out items
that have already been added to an invoice.  Finally, if this box is checked,
and if your entered the invoice details at the top of the screen, then Evergreen
will filter your search for items that have the same provider as the one that
you entered.  If you have not entered the invoice details, then Evergreen
removes this limit.  
. Sort by title (optional).  By default, results are listed by line item
number.  Check this box to sort by ascending title.
. Building the results list progressively (optional). By default, new search
results will replace previous results on the screen. Check this box for the
search results list to build with each subsequent search. This option is useful
for libraries that might search for line items by scanning an ISBN. Several
ISBNs can be scanned and then the entire result set can be selected and moved
to the invoice in a batch.
. Click _Search_.
+

+
. Use the _Next_ button to page through results, or select a line item(s), and
click _Add Selected Items to Invoice_.
.The rows that you selected are highlighted, and the invoice summary at the
top of the screen updates.
+
image::media/Search_for_line_items_from_an_invoice3.jpg[Search_for_line_items_from_an_invoice3]
+
. Click the _Invoice_ tab to see the updated invoice.
. Evergreen automatically enters the number of items that was ordered in the
# Invoiced and # Paid fields. Adjust these quantities as needed.
. Enter the amount that the organization was billed. This entry will
automatically propagate to the Paid field. The _Per Copy_ field calculates the
cost of each copy by dividing the amount that was billed by the number of
copies for which the library paid.

[NOTE]
The bibliographic line items are listed in the next section of the invoice.
Along with the _title_ and _author_ of the line items is a _summary of copies
ordered, received, invoiced, claimed,_ and _cancelled_. You can also view the
_amounts estimated, encumbered,_ and _paid_ for each line item. Finally, each
line item has a _line item ID_ and links to the _selection list_ (if used) and
the _purchase order_.
+
. Evergreen automatically enters the number of items that was ordered in the
# Invoiced and # Paid fields. Adjust these quantities as needed.
. Enter the amount that the organization was billed. This entry will
automatically propagate to the Paid field. The _Per Copy_ field calculates the
cost of each copy by dividing the amount that was billed by the number of

order. For example, an invoice is received for a shipment with items on
purchase order #1 and purchase order #2. When the invoice arrives, purchase
order #1 is retrieved, and the invoice is created. To receive the items on
purchase order #2, simply link the invoice to the purchase order. You do not
need to recreate it.

== Receive Items From an Invoice ==

This feature enables users to receive items from an invoice.  Staff can receive individual copies, or they can receive items in batch.

=== Receive Items in Batch (List Mode) ===

In this example, we have created a purchase order, added line items and copies, and activated the purchase order.  We will create an invoice from the purchase order, receive items, and invoice them.  We will receive the items in batch from the invoice.

1) Retrieve a purchase order.

2) Click *Create Invoice*.

image::media/Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice1.jpg[Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice1]

3) The blank invoice appears.  In the top half of the invoice, enter descriptive information about the invoice.  In the bottom half of the invoice, enter the number of items for which you were invoiced, the amount that you were billed, and the amount that you paid.


image::media/Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice2.jpg[Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice2]


4) Click *Save*.  You must choose a save option before you can receive items.


5) The screen refreshes.  In the top right corner of the screen, click *Receive Items*.


6) The *Acquisitions Invoice Receiving* screen opens.  By default, this screen enables users to receive items in batch, or *Numeric Mode*.  You can select the number of copies that you want to receive; you are not receiving specific copies in this mode. 


7) Select the number of copies that you want to receive.  By default, the number that you invoiced will appear.  In this example, we will receive one copy of each title.


NOTE: You cannot receive fewer items than 0 (zero) or more items than the number that you ordered.


8) Click *Receive Selected Copies*.


image::media/Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice4.jpg[Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice4]


9) When you are finished receiving items, close the screen.  You can repeat this process as you receive more copies.



=== Receive Specific Copies (Numeric Mode) ===

In this example, we have created a purchase order, added line items and copies, and activated the purchase order.  We will create an invoice from the purchase order, receive items, and invoice them. We will receive specific copies from the invoice.  This function may be useful to libraries who purchase items that have been barcoded by their vendor. 


1) Complete steps 1-5 in the previous section.

2) The *Acquisitions Invoice Receiving* screen by default enables user to receive items in batch, or *Numeric Mode*.  Click *Use List Mode* to receive specific copies.

3) Select the check boxes adjacent to the copies that you want to receive.  Leave unchecked the copies that you do not want to receive.

4) Click *Receive Selected Copies*.  

image::media/Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice5.jpg[Receive_Items_From_an_Invoice5]


The screen will refresh.  Copies that have not yet been received remain on the screen so that you can receive them when they arrive.


5) When all copies on an invoice have been received, a message confirms that no copies remain to be received.

6) The purchase order records that all items have been received.
