Evergreen has a public OPAC that meets WCAG guidelines
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), which helps make the OPAC accessible to
users with a range of disabilities. This part of the documentation explains how
to use the Evergreen public OPAC. It covers the basic catalog and more advanced
search topics. It also describes the ``My Account'' tools users have to find
information and manage their personal library accounts through the OPAC. This
section could be used by staff and patrons but would be more useful for staff as
a generic reference when developing custom guides and tutorials for their users.
