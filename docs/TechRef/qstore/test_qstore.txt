test_qstore

This command-line utility exercises most of the code used in the qstore server, but
without the complications of sending and receiving OSRF messages.

Synopsis:

test_qstore  [options]  query_id

Query_id is the id of a row in the query.stored_query table, defining a stored query.

The program reads the specified row in query.stored_query, along with associated rows
in other tables, and displays the corresponding query as an SQL command.  Optionally it
may execute the query, display the column names of the query result, and/or display the
bind variables.

In order to connect to the database, test_qstore uses various connection parameters
that may be specified on the command line.  Any connection parameter not specified
reverts to a plausible default.

The database password may be read from a specified file or entered from the keyboard.

Options:

-b  Boolean; Display the name of any bind variables, and their default values.

-D  Specifies the name of the database driver; defaults to "pgsql".

-c  Boolean; display column names of the query results, as assigned by PostgreSQL.

-d  Specifies the database name; defaults to "evergreen".

-h  Specifies the hostname of the database; defaults to "localhost".

-i  Specifies the name of the IDL file; defaults to "/openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml".

-p  Specifies the port number of the database; defaults to 5432.

-u  Specifies the database user name; defaults to "evergreen".

-v  Boolean; Run in verbose mode, spewing various detailed messages.  This option is not
	likely to be useful unless you are troubleshooting the code that loads the stored
	query.

-w  Specifies the name of a file containing the database password (no default).

-x  Boolean: Execute the query and display the results.
