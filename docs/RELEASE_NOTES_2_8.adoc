---------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.7

* Fixes a bug where phrase searching in the catalog failed when the phrase
started or ended with punctuation.
* Fixes a bug where changing the sort order in the public catalog to
"relevance" could fail.

Evergreen 2.8.7
---------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.6

Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Adds EDI Cancel Code 85 to the acquisitions cancel reason table.
* Fixes an issue where the "Expand All" button in selection lists was not
working.

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~
* Improves sorting in holdings maintenance so that copies sort first by parts
then by barcode.

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes an issue where the wrong last billing type and last billing note were
displaying for some transactions.
* Now calculates credit payments as integers to avoid rounding errors with
large sets of small billings.
* Fixes an issue in the patron record where staff was unable to retrieve the
Message Center interface after visiting the Triggered Events page and vice 
versa.
* Now displays the short version of a title on the Place Holds screen when
placing metabib holds to reduce instances where the wrong title/format
displayed.

OPAC
~~~~
* Fixes an issue where detailed search results showed parts for items that 
didn't have parts.
* Changes the e-mail address check on password reset requests so that it is no
longer case sensitive.
* Fixes a problem where users were unable to navigate through multiple pages of
their holds history.
* Removes undefined values from ISBN and ISSN arrays to prevent empty requests
from being sent to added content providers.
* Fixes an issue where the kids catalog was not displaying title information
after hold placement or after adding a title to a list.
* Corrects the kids catalog holds notification default preferences to allow for
SMS text messaging options.


Miscelleneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes an issue where the Selfcheck fines receipt templated printed all open
billable transactions, regardless of whether it had bills associated with it.
* Fixes an issue that prevented Selfcheck's "Print List" for holds view from
working.

Evergreen 2.8.6
---------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.5

Acquisitions / Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Allows the Z39.50 itnerface and the acquisitions MARC Federated Search
interface to search the UPC index of the local catalog if Z39.50 is configured
to search that field.
* Fixes an issue where spaces in a PO name cause the system to improperly
process EDI response messages.

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes a problem where the balance owed was miscalculated when a row
was deleted from money.billing.
* Fixes an issue where credit card payments made via PayflowPro failed because
Evergreen does not install the PayflowPro module by default.
* Changes credit card payment behavior so that the patron's billing address will
be read when the patron has no mailing address. If all address fields are 
properly set by the API caller except the country and the
patron has no addresses, the system will attempt to determine the country from
library settings. If insufficient address data is provided, the system will
return an invalid params Event.

OPAC
~~~~
* Fixes an issue where the reset password link was displaying even on systems
that had disabled the ability to reset passwords.
* Fixes an issue where the journal type search did not work when entering it as
the second or third input on the advanced search screen.

Evergreen 2.8.5
---------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.4

Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Protects the stock acquisitions cancel reasons from deletion since they
are required to properly handle EDI order responses.
* Changes the copy location dropdown so that users can view and select copy
locations owned outside the workstation branch if they have permission to do so. 
This fix also adds the copy location's owning org unit to the display.

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Allows use of more special characters, including - and +, when
entering a library's main email address in the Organizational Units
editor.
* Fixes an issue where marc_export attempts to call a non-existent field
on MARC::Record if an error occurs while exporting authority records.

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes the mapping between copies and the target part when using "Merge
Selected" in the Monographic Parts interface.
* Fixes an issue with the horizontal scrollbar bar in the MARC import
queue inspector so the focus no longer jumps to the top of the screen
when attempting to use the scrollbar.
* Hides the staff-client saved searches header from screen readers when
using the public catalog in non-staff mode.

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~
* When placing a hold via the staff client and clicking Advanced Hold
Options, fixes an issue where the barcode formfield populated with the
staff member's barcode.
* Fixes an issue where some holds with a higher proximity were
preferred over holds with a lower proximity because the list of
proximities of elgible copies was sorting ASCIIbetically instead of
numerically.
* Adds a delete flag for monographic parts, fixes staff client errors that
were previously caused by deleted parts, and cancels any holds attached to
those deleted parts.
* Fixes an internal error that appeared when trying to renew an item on the
booking resource list through the public catalog. Users will now get a message
saying they do not have permission to renew the item. 


Public Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes an issue where unclosed phrase searches returned zero results and
tied up the open-ils.storage process.
* Fixes an issue where phrase searches were ignoring modifiers used in relevance
ranking, leading to poorly-ranked results.
* Fixes an issue where parameters weren't properly maintained when
searching by copy location group.

Reports
~~~~~~~
* Adds support for UTF-8 in the Reports interface.

Evergreen 2.8.4
---------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.3

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes an issue where transactions with checkin-generated fines that 
previously had a balance of zero were prematurely closing.
* Fixes an issue where empty patron searches lead to heavy queries ending
in a client error. Empty patron searches will now exit early with no results.
* Provides validation on the patron self-registration form to prevent users
from entering the date of birth in the wrong date format.

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~
* Fixes an issue where all matches were not displaying during a Vandelay
authority record import. The fix ensures a row is added for every authority
record match in the Vandelay match grid, even when multiple matches refer to
the same authority record.

Preventing improper data deletion from subfield $e
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release contains a fix for LP bug 1484281, "authority data may be
deleted during propagation with current values of
authority.control_set_authority_field."

For more details see: https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1484281

The related upgrade script from this release removes subfield $e
in authority tags 100 and 110, but only from the Evergreen default
"LoC" authority control set configuration. If your Evergreen system is
set up with additional authority control sets besides the default
"LoC" one, you will need to run the following pieces of SQL code.

First verify that you have an additional control set besides the
default of "LoC". Run the following SQL code and write down the ID
number for your additional control set. The number will be an integer
like 101.

[source,sql]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
select *
from authority.control_set
where name != 'LoC'
order by id
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following code you will need to change the two sections of
"control_set = XYZ". Change the part labeled with the text "XYZ", with
the ID number from the above query.

If the above query displayed more than one additional authority
control set, then you will need to run the code below once for each
additional control set ID number.

[source,sql]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE authority.control_set_authority_field
SET sf_list = REGEXP_REPLACE( sf_list, 'e', '', 'i')
WHERE tag = '100' AND control_set = XYZ AND  sf_list ILIKE '%e%';

UPDATE authority.control_set_authority_field
SET sf_list = REGEXP_REPLACE( sf_list, 'e', '', 'i')
WHERE tag = '110' AND control_set = XYZ AND  sf_list ILIKE '%e%';
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Evergreen 2.8.3
---------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.2

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Restores sort order in the patron's Items Out display so that overdue items
sort to the top.
* Changes the behavior of the checkin API so that future backdates are 
successfully ignored.
* Fixes a problem where amnesty mode was ignored when backdating checkins.
* Allows SIP to honor floating copy checkin locations.

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

* Changes the behavior of the authority linker to now ignore $e and $4 in bib
name headings.

Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changes the behavior of the end-of-year process so that fund tags will now
remain on propagated funds.
* Allows staff with the CREAT_PURCHSE_ORDER permission to view distribution
formulas, making it possible to use them for PO batch update operations.

Public Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improves performance of OPAC searches using format filters.
* Removes opac_invisible copies from consideration when displaying copies
on the search results page.

users with null card values.
* Updates the XULRunner URL in Makefile.am, allowing makefile to continue
building the staff client.
* Fixes a problem where the added content handler was not properly closing
sockets.
* Fixes a problem where the Library Settings History was not properly
keeping the latest five settings per org unit. 
* Expands safe token generation to include user ID in the cached data, which
can be retrieved later for activity logging.
* Makes xpath-based record attribute definitions work.

Evergreen 2.8.2
---------------

This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.1

Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue where a double-scan at checkin causes two holds to capture for
the same item.
* In patron registration, fixes a broken link in the alert informing staff that
a patron with the same name already exists.
* Fixes an issue where fully-paid long overdue items still appeared in the
Other/Special Circulations window.
* Fixes an error that appeared when staff tried to renew lost, claims returned
or long overdue item.
* Fixes a "Return to Record" link on the call number texting confirmation
screen. The link previously broke in cases when the user was prompted to

* Removes long overdue circs from the total items out count in My Account. 

Public Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changes the behavior of the "Add Rows" link on the advanced search screen
so that it no longer opens duplicate rows.
* Removes the Bib Call Number from the query type selector.
* Removes publication-specific information from a metarecord search results
page

aren't needed during authority record reingest.

Evergreen 2.8.1
----------------
This release contains several bugfixes improving on Evergreen 2.8.0.

Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue where direct charges were not disencumbered when the charge
was removed from the PO or the PO was canceled.
* Fixes an issue where direct charges were not calculated in the PO estimated price.
* Refreshes the PO summary ammounts (spent, encumbered, estimated) each time
an amount-changing event occurs.

Patron message center fixes and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue where the user didn't receive an ackowledgement after
deleting a message.
* Displays the unread message count in the page title for increased visibility.
* Repositions the patron messages link to the dashboard button bar.
* For messages that originate from public notes, adjusts the sending library to be the workstation library, not the home library of the note creator.
* Improves styling for messages by using pre-wrap, which allows longer messages
to wrap properly.
* Fixes an issue where users already viewing a message cannot return to the message list by clicking on the 'Message" button in the patron dashboard.

Fine generator fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue where payment for a lost-then-returned item was not applied to overdues.
* Fixes an issue where overdue fines could be doubled if both
restore-overdue-on-lost-return and generate-new-overdues-on-lost-return
are enabled.

Clear hold shelf checkin modifier fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixes a network error that occurred when using the Clear Hold Shelf checkin modifier.

Fix Crash in Collections User Balance Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously a patron in collections that paid off all transactions would cause a
crash and stop processing any balance summary file that they are supposed to
appear in. Now user balance summaries can be created in full even if some users
have a 0 balance.

Remove the ‡biblios.net Z39.50 target from seed data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Z39.50 target at z3950.biblios.net/bibliographic has not worked
for years, so its service definition is no longer provided in the
seed data for new installations of Evergreen.

Users of existing Evergreen systems should consider removing
the Z39.50 definition for ‡biblios.net. This can be done from
Admin | Server Administration | Z39.50 Servers in the staff
client.

Set resource limits for Clark Kent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several parameters are now available for the reporter daemon process
(`clark-kent.pl`) to control resource usage.  These can be used to
reduce the chances that a malformed report can cause indigestion
on a database or reports server.  The new parameters, which can be
set in `opensrf.xml` or as command-line switches for `clark-kent.pl` are

* `//reporter/setup/statement_timeout` / `--statement-timeout`

Number of minutes to allow a report's underlying SQL query
to run before it gets cancelled.  Default value is
60 minutes.  If a report's query gets cancelled, the
error_text value will be set to a valid that indicates that
the allowed time was exceeded.

* `//reporter/setup/max_rows_for_charts` / `--max-rows-for-charts`

Number of rows permitted in the query's output before
Clark Kent refuses to attempt to draw a graph. Default
value is 1,000 rows.

* `//reporter/setup/resultset_limit` / `--resultset-limit`

If set, truncates the report's output to the specified
number of hits.  Note that it will not be apparent
to a staff user if the report's output has been
truncated.  Default value is unlimited.

The report concurrency (i.e., the number of reports that Clark
Kent will run in parallel) can now also be controlled via
the `opensrf.xml` setting `//reporter/setup/parallel`.

Install purge_pending_users.srfsh to /openils/bin by default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since purge_pending_users.srfsh is in the example crontab, it should
be installed to the Evergreen binaries directory (typically /openils/bin)
by default.

New Features
------------



Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~



==== Duplicate Order Detection Improvements ====

Provides tools to make it more clear to staff when a purchase order or
items on an order have been ordered before.

===== Prevent Duplicate PO Names =====

Staff now have the option to specify a PO name during PO creation.
If the selected name is already in use by another PO at or below
the ordering agency for the PO, the user is warned, the save/submit
operations are disabled, and a link to the existing PO is display.  The
link opens the related PO in a new tab when clicked.

Selecting a name which is not yet used or clearing the name field
(which defaults upon creation to the PO ID) will clear the warning and
re-enable the submit/save operation.

Similarly, when editing a PO, if the user attempts to use a name already
used, the user will be warned and a link to the offending PO will be
displayed.

===== Show Existing Copies =====

In the select list and PO view interfaces, beside the lineitem ID #, we
now also display the number of catalog copies already owned at or below
the ordering agency for the bib record in question.

The count does not include copies linked to the lineitem in question
nor does it include copies that are in some form of lost, missing, or
discard status.

==== Sticky Org Unit Selector ====

The Context Org Unit Selector on the Funds screen will now remember and default
to the most-recently selected org unit. On first use, the selector will 
continue to default to the workstation org unit.


Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apache Access Handler: OpenILS::WWW::AccessHandler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This Perl module is intended for limiting patron access to configured locations
in Apache. These locations could be folder trees, static files, non-Evergreen
dynamic content, or other Apache features/modules. It is intended as a more
patron-oriented and transparent version of the OpenILS::WWW::Proxy and
OpenILS::WWW:Proxy::Authen modules.

Instead of using Basic Authentication the AccessHandler module instead redirects
to the OPAC for login. Once logged in additional checks can be performed, based
on configured variables:

 * Permission Checks (at Home OU or specified location)
 * Home OU Checks (Org Unit or Descendant)
 * "Good standing" Checks (Not Inactive or Barred)

As the AccessHandler module does not actually serve the content it is
protecting, but instead merely hands control back to Apache when it is done
authenticating, you can protect almost anything you can serve with Apache.

Use Cases
+++++++++
The general use of this module is to protect access to something else.
Here are some examples of what you can protect:

 * Apache features
 ** Automatic Directory Indexes
 ** Proxies
 *** Electronic Databases
 *** Software on other servers/ports
 * Non-Evergreen software
 ** Timekeeping software for staff
 ** Specialized patron request packages
 * Static files and folders
 ** Semi-public Patron resources
 ** Staff-only downloads


Deleted flag for copy locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A deleted flag is now available for copy locations, allowing them to be
"deleted" without losing statistical information for circulations in a given
copy location. It also allows copy locations that are only used by deleted
items to be deleted.

When a copy location is deleted, it will remain in the database, but will be
removed from display in the staff client and the catalog.





New TPAC config option: Show more details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a new option for TPAC to show more details by default.

The option to show full details as a default may be especially
important for e-content.  Valid values are 'true', 'false' and 'hide'.

Setting this to 'true' shows full details by default but allows the link
to appear for 'Show Fewer Details'. The 'hide' option shows full details
and also suppresses the link from displaying at all.

Look for "show_more_details.default" in config.tt2.




Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~



==== Vandelay Authority Record Match Sets ====

Vandelay MARC Batch Import/Export now supports match sets for authority
record import matching.  Matches can be made against MARC tag/subfield
entries and against a record's normalized heading + thesaurus.  Internal
identifier (901c) matches are also supported.

===== UI Modifications =====

 * Authority matches display the normalized heading/thesuarus for each 
   match.
 * Item import summary is not displayed for authority queues, since
   items cannot be imported with authority records.





Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~



Active date display in OPAC 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a library uses the copy's active date to calculate holds age protection,
the active date will display with the copy details instead of the create date
in the staff client view of the catalog. Libraries that do not enable the 
_Use Active Date for Age Protection_ library setting will continue to display
the create date.




Option to stop billing activity on zero-balance billed  transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new setting is available via the Library Settings Editor to stop any billing
activity on fully-paid lost or longoverdue transactions. When the _Do not
change fines/fees on zero-balance LOST transaction_ setting is enabled, once a
lost of long overdue transaction
has been fully paid, no more lost fees will be voided or overdue fines restored
or generated if the item is returned. The setting will reduce, though not
eliminate, negative balances in the system.

New Library Setting
+++++++++++++++++++
 * Do not change fines/fees on zero-balance LOST transaction (circ.checkin.lost_zero_balance.do_not_change') - When an item has been marked lost and all
fines/fees have been completely paid on the transaction, do not void or
reinstate any fines/fees EVEN IF circ.void_lost_on_checkin and/or
circ.void_lost_proc_fee_on_checkin are enabled.  




Patron Message Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is now a new mechanism via which messages can be sent to
patrons for them to read while logged into the public catalog.

Patron messages can be generated in two ways: when a new public
note is added to the patron's record, and when an A/T event
that is configured to generate messages is processed.  Three
new default A/T event definitions are added to generate
patron messages when a hold is canceled due to lack of a target,
staff action, or the item expiring on the shelf.

In the public catalog, patrons can read their messages, mark
one or more messages as read or unread, or delete messages that
they do not want to see again.  The XUL staff client has a new
menu option on the patron display, "Message Center", that allows
staff to view messages.  Messages are intentionally not meant
to be editable by patrons or library staff.

During upgrade, existing public patron notes that are marked
public are copied over as new patron messages that are marked
as read.

There are four new fields available in the A/T event definition:

 * Message Title
 * Message Template
 * Message Library Path
 * Message User Path

If these four fields are set, when the A/T event is processed,
a message is generated in addition to whatever reactor is
specified by the event definition.  This means that, for example,
an email overdue notice can also generate a message that the
patron can view in the public catalog.




Void Lost and Long Overdue Bills on Claims Returned
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Four new settings have been added to allow sites to void lost item and long
overdue billings and processing fees when an item is marked as Claims Returned.

New Library Settings
++++++++++++++++++++
 * Void lost item billing when claims returned (circ.void_lost_on_claimsreturned)
 * Void lost item processing fee when claims returned (circ.void_lost_proc_fee_on_claimsreturned)
 * Void long overdue item billing when claims returned (circ.void_longoverdue_on_claimsreturned)
 * Void long overdue item processing fee when claims returned (circ.void_longoverdue_proc_fee_on_claimsreturned)



Staff option to place another hold on same title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a hold is successful in the client, staff will now see a link
to place another hold on the same title. This link provides some workflow
improvement for times when staff are placing holds for multiple patrons on a
newly-added title or when they are placing holds for book clubs.



OPAC
~~~~



TPAC Discoverability Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of discoverability enhancements have been made to the catalog
to better support search engines:

 * Titles of catalog pages now follow a "Page title - Library name" pattern
   to provide more specific titles in search results, bookmarks, and browser
   tabs.
 * The OpenSearch title now specifies the library name instead of the generic
   "Evergreen OpenSearch" at every scope.
 * Subject headings are now exposed as http://schema.org/about[schema:about]
   properties instead of http://schema.org/keyword[schema:keyword].
 * Electronic resources are now assigned a http://schema.org/url[schema:url]
   property, and any notes or link text are assigned a
   http://schema.org/description[schema:description] property.
 * Given a Library of Congress relator code for 1xx and 7xx fields, we now
   surface the URL for that relator code along with
   the http://schema.org/contributor[schema:contributor] property to give
   machines a better chance of understanding how the person or organization
   actually contributed to this work.
 * Linking out to related records:
   ** Given an LCCN (010 field), we link to the corresponding Library of Congress
      record using http://schema.org/sameAs[schema:sameAs].
   ** Given an OCLC number (035 field, subfield `a` beginning with `(OCoLC)`), we
      link to the corresponding WorldCat record using
      http://schema.org/sameAs[schema:sameAs].
   ** Given a URI (024 field, subfield 2 = `'uri'`), we link to the
      corresponding OCLC Work Entity record using
      http://schema.org/exampleOfWork[schema:exampleOfWork].
 * The sitemap generator script now includes located URIs as well as copies
   listed in the `asset.opac_visible_copies` materialized view, and checks
   the children or ancestors of the requested libraries for holdings as well.
 * Links that robots should not crawl, such as search result links, are now
   marked with the https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en[@rel="nofollow"]
   property.
 * Catalog pages for record details and for library descriptions now express
   a https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en[@rel="canonical"]
   link to simplify the number of variations of page URLs that could otherwise
   have been derived from different search parameters.
 * Catalog pages that do not exist now return a proper 404 "HTTP_NOT_FOUND"
   HTTP status code, and record detail pages for records that have been deleted
   now return a proper 410 "HTTP_GONE" HTTP status code, instead of returning a
   misleading 200 "OK" HTTP status code.
 * Record detail and library pages now include http://ogp.me/[Open Graph Protocol]
   markup.




Add new link to My Lists in My Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is now a direct link to "My Lists" from the "My Account" area in the 
top upper-right part of the screen.  This gives users the ability to quickly
access their lists while logged into the catalog.


Permalinks
^^^^^^^^^^
The record summary page will now offer a link to a shorter permalink that
can be used for sharing the record with others. All URL parameters are stripped
from the link with the exception of the locg and copy_depth parameters. Those
parameters are maintained so that people can share a link that displays just
the holdings from one library/system or displays holdings from all libraries
with a specific library's holdings floating to the top.



Removal of Bib Call Number Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Bib Call Number Search has been removed as a default numeric search in
the catalog. Evergreen sites that wish to restore this search to the catalog
can add the following to the numeric_qtype menu in the numeric.tt2 file.

----
 <option value="identifier|bibcn">[% l('Bib Call Number') %]</option>
----




Improved styling on Text call number screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
New styling on the _Text call number_ screen has added highlighting to the
displayed message, makes the font consistent with other text on the screen, and
displays better on mobile devices.
